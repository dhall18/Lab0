The unsorted shapes are as follows:
(1) square with perimeter 8
(2) circle with perimeter 18.8496
(3) eqtriangle with perimeter 4.5
// Side length given to the constructor was 1.5. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle is P = 3(side length). In this case, P = 3(1.5) => P = 4.5, therefore the class is functioning correctly.
(4) square with perimeter 4
(5) eqtriangle with perimeter 6
// Side length given to the constructor was 1.5. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle is P = 3(side length). In this case, P = 3(2) => P = 6, therefore the class is functioning correctly.

The shape list, sorted by area, is as follows:
(1) square with perimeter 4
(2) eqtriangle with perimeter 4.5
(3) eqtriangle with perimeter 6
(4) square with perimeter 8
(5) circle with perimeter 18.8496
// The perimeters are sorted correctly from least to greatest, therefore the comparePerimeters method and sort() function are working properly.
